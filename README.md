## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
This project was built with a certain version of Python to ensure holistic compatibility for all required modules and GPU Acceleration.

| Package  | Version |
| :---:  | :---: |
| Python  | 3.10.15 |
| TensorFlow  | 2.10.1 |
| cuDNN (OPTIONAL)  | 11.2.x |
| CUDA (OPTIONAL)  | 8.1.x |

You can view the compatibility list [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu) for GPU Acceleration support on different Python versions.

### Datasets
You can either download the full or individual distribution-ready packages from the [releases](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ffc7d1e-4989-4c0d-bda1-e999095e83e0) tab.
