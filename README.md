## ðŸŒŽ Overview of System
What is it? - It is a temporal and spatial prediction study. I took a series of features and evaluated against a set of lithological regions and fossil occurences. I produced final outputs by superimposing spatial on temporal predictions.

I explored deep-time data, subsequently built time-aware models to facilitate our predictions. In addition, I produced predictions using a singular time-step to investigate contemporaneous influence. The fundamental experimentation was driven through the following pipeline:

### âŒ› Temporal Take-Aways
- Beat all Logistic Models and Random Guessing consistently.
- Demonstrated high metrics in sedimentary landmass recognition.
- Understood preservation relationships to determine pseudo-ages of sedimentary rock.

### ðŸ—º Spatial Take-Aways

- Produced a K-Fold Cross-Validated global prediction output.
- Used virtually all elected temporal features, demonstrating consistency and validity in the study.

## ðŸ§ª Repository Overview
### ANALYSIS
The [directory](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/tree/main/ANALYSIS) contains two python scripts, both pertain to cleaning of fossil occurrence data. 

The [first](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/blob/main/ANALYSIS/ALL_FOSSILS_TO_TIMESTEP.py) tool is used to aggregate a set of cleaned occurences into timestep binning. I ended up using this for one specific feature in our investigation: 'Death Signals'.

The [second](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/blob/main/ANALYSIS/PALEODB_FOSSIL_ANALYSIS.py) tool is used in cleaning reconnaissance that I obtained from [PaleoBioDB](https://paleobiodb.org). It reads the API response CSVs, cleans entries based on, coordinate, entry No.'s, min-max age, environments and assigned temporal bins. Additionally it prints before and after quantities for this imputation. 
This is an essential script to clean the data, it is function built to operate with whichever queried data as long as they match these parameters:

| Parameter  | Example |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| max_ma  | 66 |
| min_ma  | 23 |
| envtype  | !marine / marine |
| FILENAME | 023_066_XXX.csv|
```
http://paleobiodb.org/data1.2/occs/list.csv?datainfo&rowcount&max_ma=XXX&min_ma=XXX&lithology=!other,metasedimentary,metamorphic,volcanic,unknown&envtype=XXX&show=coords,env,timebins
```

### DATASET_BUILDERS
This directory contains scripts that I used to build our .NPY datasets, they are multi-variate and are commented appropriately. The following are brief summaries of each file.
| File  | Summary |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|[DATASET_0.1X0.1DEM_NC_TO_NPY.py](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/blob/main/DATASET_BUILDERS/DATASET_0.1X0.1DEM_NC_TO_NPY.py)| Used to convert .netCDF files, specifically palaeographic NC files, into a .NPY file. Useful for evaluating raw data that doesn't need any imputation or cleaning.

No projections are applied, has support for clamping densities per cell.
|[DATASET_GISEXPORTED_CSV_TO_NPY.py](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/blob/main/DATASET_BUILDERS/DATASET_GISEXPORTED_CSV_TO_NPY.py)| Used to convert GIS exported data into .NPYs, batch converts all files in a folder for quick and efficient coversion for temporal datasets.
|[DATASET_PALEODB_DOWNLOAD_MANAGER.py](https://github.com/PrimalRex/Fossil-Locality-Prediction/blob/main/DATASET_BUILDERS/DATASET_PALEODB_DOWNLOAD_MANAGER.py)| DEPRICATED - But still may be of potential use to streamline reconnaissance due to server time-outs from PaleoBioDB.
